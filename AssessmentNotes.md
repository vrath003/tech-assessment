These notes are for evaluator of this technical assessment.

# Codespaces or Dev Containters or Local hardware machine
From the above choices I choose Codespaces because it saved my time to set up development environment. I tried to set up Dev Containers on my personal laptop initially but my machine has Window 10 Home edition build number 18031 which is less that the least build number (19051) required to install WSL (Work Station for Linux) in order to set up and configure Docker which is in turn required to configure Dev Container. 

# Choice of languages

Among the language options I was familiar with almost all the languages apart from Ruby. Therefore it was an easy choice for me to make. I choose Csharp because recently in MSD I was involved in development using csharp. I had a fresh hands-on this language.

# Files and folders of all 3 Exercices - Exercise 1, Exercise 2 and Exercise 3

1. Exercise1 folder --> This contains CodeToReview.txt file which contains code to be reviewed. All comments, feedbacks etc. are in this file.

2. Exercise2 folder --> CodeToRefactor.cs file . All refactored code lies within this file itself safely.

3. Exercise2.Tests folder --> This folder contains all xUnit tests files which in turn have xUnit tests within them. 

4. Exercise3 folder --> This folder contains the solution file for Exercise 3 names CleanGreenFieldsProject.
